# finding a point in a grid layout


### build image
    docker build --rm -f Dockerfile -t finding-a-point .

### run container
    docker run --rm -it -p 0.0.0.0:6006:6006 finding-a-point

### clone repo in container
    git checkout <branch-name>
    git pull

### run script
    python main.py -s window/triangle/hook/0/1/2

### TODOs
- [x] dynamic start
    - [x] solving substraction problem
- [x] train policy for each group of points (e.g. for each logo)
    - [?] find optimal sequence of pictures for training model (maybe new epsilon for each picture)
- [x] change measurement to accumulated reward & reward per episode
    - [X] tostring func for parameters
- [X] concept to show learning results (strategy)
    - [X] show values
    - [x] show direction strategy
        - [x] log all old qtable_direction files
- [ ] train model with neural network
- [ ] testing other algorithms instead of q-learning
- [ ] any parallelism possible?
